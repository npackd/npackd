Npackd (pronounced "unpacked") is an application store/package manager/marketplace for applications for Windows. It helps you to find and install software, keep your system up-to-date and uninstall it if no longer necessary. You can watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLJ8sv6siKQ) to better understand how it works. The process of installing and uninstalling applications is completely automated (silent or unattended installation and un-installation). 

## Add your packages
You can add you packages (a Google account is required) [here](https://npackd.appspot.com/package/new).

## Suggest software
You can [suggest](https://github.com/tim-lebedkov/npackd/issues/new) a package for inclusion if it is not yet available.

## Third party tools working with Npackd:
  * [npackd-repoeditor](http://krason.biz/software/repoeditor.html)
  * [Npackd plugin for chooie](https://github.com/TomPeters/chooie.Npackd)

  * [Npackd for Sublime Text Syntax - completions and snippets for creating Npackd XML files](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Npackd)

## Distribute your applications using Npackd!
You can also distribute your own applications using Npackd: either through your own repository or through the one mentioned above. All you have to do is to package your application as a ZIP file so it is accessible through HTTP and describe it as shown in RepositoryFormat. It is even easier if you already have an .msi or .exe installer. In most cases they can be reused without re-packaging.
